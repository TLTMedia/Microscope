Feedback:

[]When y caliper moves down, everything on the view gets realistically bigger (scale x/y, slide down).
[x]Create a side view of the scope and put it at the side of the front[]view so there are two views active simultaneously.
[]Create 8 SVG views of the lenses. 4 for fixed pivots, 4 for intermission pivots. Add drag functionality at top of lense (Warning to not touch lenses)
    [x]Modify SVG files to represent orientation of the scope better.
[]Modify setup stage to include:
    []Place slide in.
    []Toggle aperture light.
    []Control calipers to make sure specimen is under the aperture light (Perhaps popup view to show specimen orientation). 
[]Aperture knob light should increase as magnification increases
    []Low mag should have very low light.
    []High mag should have higher aperture value (more diffraction).
    []Change orientation of aperture knob to rightmost side.
[]Consider the use of event targets as opposed to hardcoded div names.
[x]Utilize bindings over setTimeout if possible.
[]Slide view should change by state changes.

[x]Debug the circular motion of the side view
[x]Attach side view to mag view so they update synchronously
[x]Coarse knob needs to moderately zoom on slide
[x]Fine knob needs to blur/unblur the slide
[]Make a middleware function between animations to translate pixel to percentage values
[]"Learning the Ropes" should be renamed to low mag
[]Turn old low mag into high mag scene.
[]Debugger should destroy highlights
[]Can we make it so that the clone blurs move with the main objects.

[]Give better feedback on the slide contents (Setup)
[]Arrows to indicate.. Might be excessive, just inline[]text of telling user to click might work.
[]Issue of sequential steps.
[]Try to make operations of drag smoother.
