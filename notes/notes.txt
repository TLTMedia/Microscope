Feedback:

[]When y caliper moves down, everything on the view gets realistically bigger (scale x/y, slide down).
[x]Create a side view of the scope and put it at the side of the front[]view so there are two views active simultaneously.
[]Create 8 SVG views of the lenses. 4 for fixed pivots, 4 for intermission pivots. Add drag functionality at top of lense (Warning to not touch lenses)
    [x]Modify SVG files to represent orientation of the scope better.
[]Modify setup stage to include:
    []Place slide in.
    []Toggle aperture light.
    []Control calipers to make sure specimen is under the aperture light (Perhaps popup view to show specimen orientation). 
[]Aperture knob light should increase as magnification increases
    []Low mag should have very low light.
    []High mag should have higher aperture value (more diffraction).
    []Change orientation of aperture knob to rightmost side.
[]Consider the use of event targets as opposed to hardcoded div names.
[x]Utilize bindings over setTimeout if possible.
[]Slide view should change by state changes. 

10/28/16
[x]Debug the circular motion of the side view
[x]Attach side view to mag view so they update synchronously
[x]Coarse knob needs to moderately zoom on slide
[x]Fine knob needs to blur/unblur the slide
[]Make a middleware function between animations to translate pixel to percentage values
[]"Learning the Ropes" should be renamed to low mag
[]Turn old low mag into high mag scene.
[]Debugger should destroy highlights
[]Can we make it so that the clone blurs move with the main objects.


11/2/16
[]Email: meilin.chan@stonybrook.edu
[x]Give better feedback on the slide contents (Setup)
[]Arrows to indicate.. Might be excessive, just inline[]text of telling user to click might work.
[]Issue of sequential steps.
[]Try to make operations of drag smoother.


—- Overview —

Intro
- Light Switch
- Condenser:		y-axis diaphragm— should always be at the top

red lens	aperture lowest good

initial state:	
	- light off
	- stage down
	- condenser down
	- slide off
	- lens that is not red


low mag/high mag	->		low/medium/high

**calibrate views
** overexposure
__ aperture- start closed

linear:
	> turn on light
	> condenser up— scale
	> slide on
	> caliper (x, y)
--- end set up

	> lenses- lowmag
	> coarse

	** cannot set diopter on low mag **
	yellow:
	> change lens
	> fine
	> diopter
	> ocular (note: don’t set on low)
	
	blue:
	> change lens
	> aperture — max
	> fine

	-> Game
	1. change slide
		> rotate red (not through white)
		> lower stage
		> reduce light
		> remove slide
		> add new slide
			> caliper (x,y)
			> coarse
			> rotate medium
			> fine
			> rotate to high
			> open aperture
			> fine
	

	2. 	 troubleshooting (fix the scope)
		> 

	3. clean scope
		> lens paper / windex

	4. field of view (measuring)
		> low mag
			> place ruler
			> caliper
		> high mag
		
	5. depth of focus
		>

	6. Orientation (e-slide)
		> 

	* warning: don’t go to oil *


--Fixed--
-Fine tuning values of microcsope to be as realistic as possible
-Responsive design when reduced
-Aperture precision not implemented yet.
-Slide content container must adjust to window changes.
    -Fix responsive design
    -Find magic numbers to ensure alignment with calipers.

-- Known Bugs/Fixes --
-Rotation not firefox compatible.
-Modify Coarse Knob to complete on clarity (white line).
-Add warnings/additional text
    -Too high of aperture light will be blinding (on low mag)
    -Too far movement of knobs may blur view. 
-Implement game modes (restriction to restrictionless)
-Deviate from framework and add a feedback button before moving forward.
-Readjust position of popup as it goes step by step
-Rewrite the popup text (directions) to be more brief.
-Play with timing of popup movement.
-Adjust slide so that it triggers its activation on top of pseudoclone.
-Play with the possibility of moving the guiding text over to the side steps (toggability).
-Overflow x on popup box.
-Create a large text box below (or above) the steps to detail a particular steps (descriptions)
-Modify header to extend use such as: returning to "Intro" scene, switching modes, etc.
-Difficulty/Quizzing are the "Games" were are implenting.
-Should only be one difficulty regarding how the microscope is being used.
-Occasional bug arises where nothing loads. Test by refreshing && disabling cache.
    -resize line 17X?
-Ensure "unsupervised" actions don't leave game unprogressable
    -Moving lenses (with resets the blur), coarse gets stuck and fine inactive
-Modify scenes/setup.js caliper positions to calibrate where x,y = 0,0.
