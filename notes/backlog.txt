—- Overview —

Intro
- Light Switch
- Condenser:		y-axis diaphragm— should always be at the top

red lens	aperture lowest good

initial state:	
	- light off
	- stage down
	- condenser down
	- slide off
	- lens that is not red


low mag/high mag	->		low/medium/high

**calibrate views
** overexposure
__ aperture- start closed

linear:
	> turn on light
	> condenser up— scale
	> slide on
	> caliper (x, y)
--- end set up

	> lenses- lowmag
	> coarse

	** cannot set diopter on low mag **
	yellow:
	> change lens
	> fine
	> diopter
	> ocular (note: don’t set on low)
	
	blue:
	> change lens
	> aperture — max
	> fine

	-> Game
	1. change slide
		> rotate red (not through white)
		> lower stage
		> reduce light
		> remove slide
		> add new slide
			> caliper (x,y)
			> coarse
			> rotate medium
			> fine
			> rotate to high
			> open aperture
			> fine
	

	2. 	 troubleshooting (fix the scope)
		> 

	3. clean scope
		> lens paper / windex

	4. field of view (measuring)
		> low mag
			> place ruler
			> caliper
		> high mag
		
	5. depth of focus
		>

	6. Orientation (e-slide)
		>

— Meetings/Discussions - 

10/17/16
Feedback:

[x]When y caliper moves down, everything on the view gets realistically bigger (scale x/y, slide down).
[x]Create a side view of the scope and put it at the side of the front[]view so there are two views active simultaneously.
[x]Create 8 SVG views of the lenses. 4 for fixed pivots, 4 for intermission pivots. Add drag functionality at top of lense (Warning to not touch lenses)
    [x]Modify SVG files to represent orientation of the scope better.
[x]Modify setup stage to include:
    [x]Place slide in.
    [x]Toggle aperture light.
    [x]Control calipers to make sure specimen is under the aperture light (Perhaps popup view to show specimen orientation). 
[x]Aperture knob light should increase as magnification increases
    [x]Low mag should have very low light.
    [x]High mag should have higher aperture value (more diffraction).
    [x]Change orientation of aperture knob to rightmost side.
[x]Utilize bindings over setTimeout if possible.
[x]Slide view should change by state changes. 

10/28/16
[x]Debug the circular motion of the side view
[x]Attach side view to mag view so they update synchronously
[x]Coarse knob needs to moderately zoom on slide
[x]Fine knob needs to blur/unblur the slide
[x]Make a middleware function between animations to translate pixel to percentage values
[x]"Learning the Ropes" should be renamed to low mag
[x]Turn old low mag into high mag scene.
[x]Debugger should destroy highlights
[x]Can we make it so that the clone blurs move with the main objects.


11/2/16
[]Email: meilin.chan@stonybrook.edu
[x]Give better feedback on the slide contents (Setup)
[]Arrows to indicate.. Might be excessive, just inline[]text of telling user to click might work.
[]Issue of sequential steps.
[]Try to make operations of drag smoother.


-- !!!RECENT!!! Backlog (Since January 27) --
[x]Fine tuning values of microcsope to be as realistic as possible
[x]Responsive design when reduced
[x]Aperture precision not implemented yet.
[x]Slide content container must adjust to window changes.
    [x]Fix responsive design
    [x]Find magic numbers to ensure alignment with calipers.
[x]Readjust position of popup as it goes step by step
[x]Play with the possibility of moving the guiding text over to the side steps (toggability).
[x]Overflow x on popup box.
[x]Create a large text box below (or above) the steps to detail a particular steps (descriptions)
[x]Modify header to extend use such as: returning to "Intro" scene, switching modes, etc.
[x]Should only be one difficulty regarding how the microscope is being used.
[x]Adjust slide so that it triggers its activation on top of pseudoclone.
[x]Implement game modes (restriction to restrictionless)
[x]Rewrite the popup text (directions) to be more brief.
[x]Difficulty/Quizzing are the "Games" were are implenting.
[x]Unneeded completion feedback when doing Tutorial (start).
[x]Need completion feedback when doing Tutorial (end)
[x]Deviate from framework and add a feedback button before moving forward.
[x]Modify scenes/setup.js caliper positions to calibrate where x,y = 0,0. 
[]Rotation not firefox compatible. (Sharin needs to look at the svg/ai file and confirm this and next backlog)
[]Modify Coarse Knob to complete on clarity (white line).
[]Occasional bug arises where nothing loads. Test by refreshing && disabling cache.
    []resize line 17X?
[]Track State machine
    []Model 1: persistent frame that updates between steps. (Model 1 is ordered)
    []Model 2: multiple frames that checks each step in a scene (Model 2 is unordered) 
    []Ensure "unsupervised" actions don't leave game unprogressable
    []Moving lenses (with resets the blur), coarse gets stuck and fine inactive
    []Too high of aperture light will be blinding (on low mag)
    []Too far movement of knobs may blur view. 
    []Add warnings/additional text
